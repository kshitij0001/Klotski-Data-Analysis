## Usage in Python Analysis

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('enhanced_dataset_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv')

# Quick overview
print(f"Dataset shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"Solvable puzzles: {df['is_solvable'].sum()}/{len(df)}")

# Feature correlation with solution length (difficulty proxy)
difficulty_features = [
    'board_density', 'goal_distance_to_target', 'solve_time_seconds',
    'total_adjacent_blocks', 'blocks_between_goal_target'
]
print(df[difficulty_features + ['solution_length']].corr()['solution_length'].sort_values(ascending=False))
